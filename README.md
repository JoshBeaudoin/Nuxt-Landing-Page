# Nuxt-Landing-Page
#Reflection Journal
For this project we just had to make a landing page using any form of nuxt, so i used nuxt 3 because thats the one i am most comfortable with. I had issues at first making everything link together then after i had it set up built a basic header and footer with vue. Theres not much to my project as i kept it simple.
i think i did pretty okay on this project like a 6/10 i think i did a pretty good job for the small amount i actually can do
